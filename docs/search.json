In the Hubert Lab, we study glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which is the most aggressive form of primary brain tumor in adults. My work aims to combine the advantages of microfluidics and 3D cell culture to develop complex, vascularized, patient-derived glioblastoma organoids in order to investigate the role of a gene, called WDR5, in GBM tumor invasion. WDR5 has been identified as a critical contributor in therapeutic resistance and epigenetic regulation of GBM, and I believe it may be partially responsible for the destructive nature and poor prognosis associated with GBM tumors.\nIn addition to my PhD project, this website will also showcase some of my undergraduate work from my time at Trine University, where I earned my BS in Biomedical Engineering, and my research experience for undergraduates (REU) at the University of Georgia. At Trine, some of my work includes the generation of a medical simulation device for learning and teaching cardiac catheterization procedures, and research on the impact of space environmental effects on the lymphatic system in the context of astronaut health. These projects were funded by Parkview Health of Fort Wayne, Indiana and the Indiana Space Grant Consortium, respectively. During my REU in Georgia, I worked in the Karumbaiah Lab, where my project was assessing the efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy using a glioblastoma-on-chip microfluidic platform. More information on these projects can be found under the “Projects” tab above.\nWhile this website is mostly intended to showcase my academic and professional work, you can also find some of my personal interests and additional information under the “About Me” tab above. I invite you to explore my website and learn more about my research, future endeavors. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects!\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

In order to further investigate the role of WDR5 in GBM, my project aims to enhance our organoid models by adding the elements of vasculature and perfusion.

    "text": "Medical Simulation Device for Cardiac Catheterization Procedures\n\nFor my senior design project at Trine, my team created a portable medical simulation device for teaching and learning how to perform cardiac catheterization procedures. The device models physiologically accurate (Womersley) fluid flow moving through the circulatory system, featuring a 3D printed patient-specific heart model, a realistic catheter insertion point mechanism, and an LCD screen user interface to adjust the simulated heart rate. Womersley flow was modeled using a piston pump programmed with Arduino coding. The piston pump creates audible heart sounds and the pressure generated causes the heart model to beat as observed in vivo. Flow can be visualized by injecting dye into the catheter insertion point while the device is running."

    "text": "Hi, my name is Lilly Speier and I’m from Hartland, Michigan. Outside of my academic and professional life, some of my interests include cooking, baking, doing yoga, and spending time with my family. I love to cook and bake labor-intensive dishes, partially for the challenge, but also to give as gifts. Some of my favorite dishes I’ve made are lasagna inspired by the show The Sopranos, and cream puffs with hand-whipped cream. My next goal is to make a croquembouche, which is essentially a cone-shaped tower of cream puffs which is held together by homemade caramel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n From left to right, this is my little sister Leah, myself, my dad David, and my mom Heather.\n\n\n\n\n This is the lasagna I made for my dad for Father’s Day, inspired by the discussion about Carmela’s lasagna in season 4 episode 5 of The Sopranos.\n\n\n\n\n This is a hot fudge cream puff with ice cream and hand-whipped cream that I made for my mom for Mother’s Day. Our family prefers using a Michigan classic for this dish, Sander’s milk chocolate hot fudge.\n\n\n\nI also enjoy doing yoga, specifically under the guidance of YouTube videos from Adriene Mishler’s channel, Yoga With Adriene. I struggle with chronic headaches and an autoimmune disorder, called ankylosing spondylitis (AS), which primarily attacks the spine, hips, and sacroiliac joints. Over time and without proper treatment, AS can cause vertebral fusion, resulting in a rigid “bamboo” spine and hunched posture. While there is no cure for AS, biologic medications and staying active can help prevent this fusion. Since yoga is a low impact exercise, it doesn’t trigger any of my symptoms and it helps me maintain regular movement throughout my spine. One of the best parts of Adriene’s channel is that she has very specific and targeted practices. Some of my favorite practices of her’s are yoga for migraines, tension release, hips and back release, and bedtime yoga.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"
