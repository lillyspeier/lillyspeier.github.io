## Generating Complex GBM *In Vitro* Models & Investigating WDR5

![](images/tme_ccf-01.jpg)In the Hubert Lab, we study glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which is the most aggressive form of primary brain tumor in adults. From a spatial loss-of-function screening, our lab and collaborators have [identified a gene called WDR5](https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.349803.122) as a key component in epigenetic regulation of the perivascular, therapy-resistant niche of our GBM organoids. In order to further investigate the role of WDR5 in GBM, my project aims to enhance our organoid models by adding the elements of vasculature and perfusion. This project is working in collaboration from the [Karumbaiah Lab](https://www.karumbaiahlab.org) at the University of Georgia's Regenerative Bioscience Center. We are still in the very beginning stages of this project, but I will continue to update this section with future updates and publications.

## Medical Simulation Device for Cardiac Catheterization Procedures

![](images/cath_lab_team.jpg)

For my senior design project at Trine, my team created a portable medical simulation device for teaching and learning how to perform cardiac catheterization procedures. The device models physiologically accurate (Womersley) fluid flow moving through the circulatory system, featuring a 3D printed patient-specific heart model, a realistic catheter insertion point mechanism, and an LCD screen user interface to adjust the simulated heart rate. Womersley flow was modeled using a piston pump programmed with Arduino coding. The piston pump creates audible heart sounds and the pressure generated causes the heart model to beat as observed *in vivo*. Flow can be visualized by injecting dye into the catheter insertion point while the device is running.

## Nanotechnology & Biomedicine NSF REU

In the summer of 2022, I participated in the Nanotechnology and Biomedicine NSF-funded REU at the University of Georgia. Here, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant in the Karumbaiah Lab, where my project was assessing the efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy using a glioblastoma-on-chip microfluidic platform. In addition to presenting my poster at our program symposium, as shown above, I also presented at the 2022 Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) annual conference in San Antonio, Texas.
